This can simply be achieved by using <code>onItemClick</code> event.</p>\n<p>To make it more clear, let's assume you have dropdowns for country, state and city; and their values are interdependent on each other. Well, in such cases you can use events emitted by multiselect dropdown like <code>onItemClick</code>, <code>onOpen</code>, <code>onClose</code>, etc.</p>\n<p><ms-events-advanced></ms-events-advanced></p>\n<p>In case of searching something in textbox you can listen to <code>onSearchChange</code> and <code>onClear</code> events. While using grouping feature, you can use <code>onGroupItemClick</code> event to keep eyes on grouped options selection.</p>\n\n</div>\n<!-- links to this doc:\n-->\n<!-- links from this doc:\n - /guide/callbacks#callbacks\n - https://ngx-lib.github.io/multiselect/guide/events\n-->"
